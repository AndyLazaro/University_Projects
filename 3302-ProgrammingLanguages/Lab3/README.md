This lab we were tasked with creating a python program that is able to read RPN notation and calculate the result of the expression

my implementation of the program involves using a stack to get the numbers and push them into the stack and then use the switch to do the operations once a operand
symbol shows up in the string




assumptions:
 - each element is delimited by a space
 - every line of RPN will have a single result at the end
 - no characters other than numbers and a few operands
